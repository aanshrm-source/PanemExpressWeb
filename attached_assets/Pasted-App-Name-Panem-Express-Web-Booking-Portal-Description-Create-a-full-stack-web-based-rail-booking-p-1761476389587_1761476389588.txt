App Name: Panem Express Web Booking Portal
Description:
Create a full-stack web-based rail-booking portal (similar in workflow to IRCTC) for the Panem Express, with a modern web interface and zero online payment (payment is made at station). The app shall include:

Core Features:

User Registration & Login:

Users register with username, password and email (their Gmail address).

Users log in to manage bookings.

Route & Date Selection:

A fixed list of routes (e.g., Delhi → Mumbai, Mumbai → Delhi, etc.) each with defined distances.

Users select travel date from a calendar widget.

Seat availability is tracked per route + date.

Coach/Class & Seat Map UI:

For each route & date: 5 coaches, 5 rows × 4 seats.

Each coach corresponds to a class: Business, 1st Class, Economy, 2nd Class, Non A/C.

Seat map UI shows Available vs Booked seats; users can select seats.

Fare Calculation:

Fare = distance × rate per km (based on class)

Show fare before confirmation.

Age validation: users enter passenger age; if age < 7 → not allowed to book alone. Age > 125 → invalid.

Senior discount: age ≥ 60 get 20% off.

Booking Flow:

User picks route, date, coach, seat, passenger name and age.

Unique PNR generated per booking.

Booking confirmed in system; user message: “Pay at station and present this PNR”.

Persist booking under route, date so seat no longer available for that slot (even after logout/login).

Cancellation Flow:

Logged-in user can view bookings (their email) and cancel before travel date.

On cancel: seat becomes available, status updated.

Email Notifications via Gmail:

After booking, send confirmation email to user’s Gmail: route, date, coach, seat, PNR, fare, instruction to pay at station.

After cancellation, send cancellation email.

Use Gmail SMTP with App Password (enter sender Gmail & app password once in settings).

Admin or Shared Data:

Seat availability and bookings persist globally (for all users) by route & date.

New users logging in cannot book seats already booked.

Web Deployment & Free Plan:

Deploy as web app (URL accessible via browser).

Use Replit’s free tier only (no paid add-ons).

Ensure no online payment gateway is integrated; payment handled offline at station.

Responsive UI:

Designed to work on desktop and tablets.

Clear seat map visuals, route/ date/ booking summary screens.

Data Model Highlights (for developer):

Users: id, username, hashed_password, email

Routes: id, name, distance_km

Bookings: id, user_id, route_id, date, coach, row, column, passenger_name, passenger_age, fare, pnr, status

Seats: derived from bookings per route/date/coach/row/column

EmailSettings: sender_email (fixed), app_password (securely stored)
